# 🚀 FPrime-OrbitSim

**Real-time Orbital Simulation using NASA's F Prime Framework (Raspberry Pi Hardware-in-the-Loop)**  
*A bridge between spacecraft dynamics theory and embedded flight software implementation.*

---

## 📌 Abstract

This project implements a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) orbital simulation using **NASA’s F´ (F Prime)** flight software framework on **Raspberry Pi**, integrating:

- 📡 *Keplerian orbital propagation*
- 🎯 *Quaternion-based attitude kinematics*
- 🔍 *Early-stage fault monitoring and recovery*
- 💡 *Low-level C++ implementation for real-time processing*
- 📐 *Scientific validation against MATLAB models and academic feedback*

✔ **Developed as part of the “Physics of Space Systems” course (EP 615.744) at Johns Hopkins University.**  
✔ Received **strong academic endorsement** from the course instructor (formerly NASA).  
✔ Preparing for **live demo at the NASA JPL F Prime Workshop – February 2026**.
