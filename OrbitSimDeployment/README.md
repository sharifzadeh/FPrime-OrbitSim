# OrbitSimDeployment Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the OrbitSimDeployment Application

In order to build the OrbitSimDeployment application, or any other F´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd OrbitSimDeployment
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the OrbitSimDeployment application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd OrbitSimDeployment
fprime-gds
```


To run the ground system without starting the OrbitSimDeployment app:
```

cd OrbitSimDeployment
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd OrbitSimDeployment/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./OrbitSimDeployment -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```

  - CCSDS protocol implementation
  - Uplink/downlink data handling
  - Frame processing and routing

- **FileHandling**: File Transfer & Command Sequencing
  - File upload and download services
  - Parameter database management
  - File system operations

- **DataProducts**: Data Product Management
  - Data product cataloging
  - Storage and retrieval capabilities
  - Product metadata management
